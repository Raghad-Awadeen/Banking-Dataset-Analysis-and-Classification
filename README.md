# 🏦 Banking Dataset Analysis and Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing a **banking dataset** containing **customer demographics, banking activities, and marketing campaign responses**.  

It aims to uncover patterns in **customer behavior**, evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and predict **customer subscription to term deposits** using machine learning models.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
✔ **Customer Information** (age, job, marital status, education)  
✔ **Banking Activities** (balance, loan history, number of contacts)  
✔ **Marketing Campaign Response** (whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit)

## 📜 Project Steps  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values and **convert categorical data** (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).  
   - Detect and remove **outliers** using statistical methods.  

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize customer demographics & banking behaviors.  
   - Identify **factors influencing term deposit subscription**.  

3️⃣ **Model Development & Training**  
   - Train models: **Random Forest, XGBoost**.  
   - Use **cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning**.  

4️⃣ **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Assess models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall,and F1-score**.  
   - Handle **class imbalance** using resampling techniques.  

5️⃣ **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identify **customer segments most likely to subscribe**.  
   - Suggest **targeted marketing strategies** for better campaign performance.
